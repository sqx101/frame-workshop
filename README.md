# Lil's Coding Sesson #1 - Warpcast Frames

Presented by [mulf](https://warpcast.com/mulfdev.eth)

## Description

In this session reviewed how to set up a static frame on Warpcast. We followed the [docs](https://warpcast.notion.site/Farcaster-Frames-4bd47fe97dc74a42a48d3a234636d8c5) provided by the WC team. The end result is hosted on [railway](https://railway.app) so it can be reached by the warpcast servers.
